# 📊 Business School MBA Dataset – BI & Statistical Analysis

Welcome to this demo project showcasing how data can help educational institutions make informed, data-driven decisions. This analysis was inspired by a fabricated dataset designed to mimic real-world business school outcomes.

---

## 📁 About the Dataset

The dataset contains information about students from the **first graduating MBA class** of a startup business school. It includes:

- Application data
- Academic performance (Undergrad + MBA)
- Work experience
- Employability scores (before & after MBA)
- Placement status and salary

> **Note:** This is not real-world data. It is artificially created to help demonstrate data analysis, cleaning, and visualization techniques.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Use **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **statistical techniques** to extract insights.
- Visualize key findings.
- Make practical recommendations for the business school.

---

## 🧪 Key Techniques Used

- Basic statistics & data cleaning
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, or Excel)
- One-sample & two-sample **t-tests**
- **Correlation** analysis
- **Linear regression** (simple & multiple)
- BI insights for decision-making

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📌 Students with **prior work experience** earned higher salaries and had better MBA grades.
- 🎯 **60% of students** were placed within 2 months of graduation.
- 🧑‍🎓 Undergrad in **CS, Business, or Engineering** correlated with higher MBA performance.
- 📉 **MBA grades didn’t predict employability** or salary—skills & experience mattered more.
- 📊 Students with **C/D MBA grades** saw **100+ point improvements** in employability.
- 💸 **No strong correlation** found between salary and other dataset features.
